"""Schema definition.

Table definitions live here and are the target Alembic compares against when
autogenerating a migration. Business tables arrive with Milestone 1, derived
from ``docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md``; this module currently holds only the
infrastructure table the persistence layer itself needs.

Conventions are declared once, in :data:`NAMING_CONVENTION`. Without them SQLite
invents constraint names, and an unnamed constraint cannot be dropped by a
migration -- a problem that surfaces the first time a constraint needs changing,
by which point every user has a database full of anonymous constraints.
